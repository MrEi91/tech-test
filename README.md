# tech-test `QLUE`

#### USAGE
```
$ git clone git@github.com:MrEi91/tech-test.git
```
Change directory to server-side
```
$ npm install or npm i
$ npm run dev
```

And then open new tab on terminal, change directory to client-side
```
$ npm install or npm i
$ npm start
```

If you find this on terminal (directory client-side), then choose yes or Y.
```
Something is already running on port 3000. Probably:
  node app.js
  in /home/mrei91/Documents/hacktiv8-course/qlue-test/server

Would you like to run the app on another port instead? [Y/n]
```
